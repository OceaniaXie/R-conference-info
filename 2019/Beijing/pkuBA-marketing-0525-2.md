### 1 楚燕来：The Unintended Consequences of Tariff Retaliation: Evidence from the Chinese Automobile Market  

#### 个人简介

楚燕来，中国人民大学营销系教授。

#### 报告摘要

This paper adopts a novel perspective to assess the impact of tariff wars in the context of globalized production. Using automobile sales data in China, we find that China’s retaliatory tariff against the U.S. increased sales of U.S. imports, increased sales of U.S. brands in the import segment, and decreased sales of China-made U.S. brands in the domestic segment. The increased sales of imported U.S. brands was driven by the advertising effect of the tariff war, while the decreased sales of China-made U.S. brands was caused by consumer boycotts. The net profit impact on U.S. brands was positive due to the much higher margins for imported cars. These findings suggest that a tariff war under globalization can be counterproductive and have unintended consequences.

### 2 马雪静：Highest Contributions from Others: A Dampening Effect on PWYW Payment

#### 报告摘要

As an innovative way to monetize online content, Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) pricing has emerged on many online platforms by enabling users to pay to content contributors voluntarily. Unlike traditional PWYW pricing which is usually implemented within private context, individuals’ payment behavior can always be observed publicly in social context on these online platforms. In this paper, we analyze how others’ payment behavior influence one’s own payment behavior under such type of PWYW pricing. Specifically, we focus on the effect of the highest contribution from others and examine three potential explanations: anchoring, signaling, and crowd-out. We develop a set of theoretical predictions on individual payment incidence and payment amount based on each explanation. We then conduct an empirical analysis using a large-scale, individual-level dataset with 2.7 million observations from a live streaming platform with PWYW pricing. We uncover a robust, yet striking finding: namely, the highest payment from others has a negative effect on both individual payment incidence and payment amount, suggesting that the crowd-out effect is the primary driving force. Furthermore, we find that the crowd-out effect is attenuated by individuals’ experience with live streaming viewing and gift payments on the platform. Evidence from a cohort analysis suggests that there exists individual heterogeneity. Our findings have important managerial implications for firms that adopt PWYW pricing in a social context. While highlighting large payments from others is commonly used by many online platforms to induce more and higher payments, it could in fact do the opposite by hurting the revenue of the platform, as the information of the highest payment from others reduces individuals’ payment incentives among the majority of viewers.

### 3 吴少辉：How Is Mobile User Behavior Different?—A Hidden Markov Model of Mobile Application Usage Dynamics

#### 个人简介

吴少辉，清华大学营销系博士生。

#### 报告摘要

Mobile application usage is becoming an essential activity in many people’s daily lives. Compared with PC internet, mobile internet usage is ubiquitous, temporally fragmented, and more context-dependent. Thus far research is limited on the mechanism of mobile app usage and the effects of context, even as usage continues to grow. In this paper, we aim to develop a framework to capture the underlying mechanism of mobile app usage, taking into account its unique time-fragmented feature and the possible impacts of contextual factors. To this end, we propose a hidden Markov model (HMM) and calibrate it using a consumer panel that contains real-time app usage information. We find three hidden states driving mobile app usage: utilitarian, social, and hedonic. Consumers have multiple intentions in the utilitarian state but are relatively single-minded in either the social or hedonic state. The state dynamic is volatile: Chains of continuous utilitarian states and hedonic states intercommunicate frequently with densely intermittent social states. Such a volatile state dynamic provides an antecedent for the fragmented-time mobile usage phenomena. Contextual factors—in particular, location and time of day—influence the state dynamic, e.g., its volatility varies across different locations and times of day. In sum, our analysis depicts the following picture: In the mobile internet era, consumers take advantage of relatively long free-time windows for functional and entertainment activities, while exploiting short micro-moments for social activity. Furthermore, with the help of mobile internet technology, consumers seem to (1) utilize more micro-moments outside the office or in the morning as a complement to work, and (2) reserve more micro-moments in the evening for relaxation and entertainment, all at the expense of social activities.

### 4 张晗：What's Your Risk Attitude On A Grey Day: The Case of Air Quality and Financial Product Choice

#### 个人简介

张晗，北京大学营销系博士生。

#### 报告摘要

Using investment transaction data from an online financial product platform in China, we find that air pollution does not affect total investment amount, but it changes the distribution of investment on financial products with different risk levels. In particular, higher level of air pollution shifts consumers' financial investments towards products with higher risk. In addition to the distribution-shift effect, there also exists an adaption effect: If the severe air pollution has lasted for multiple days, the distribution-shift effect is weakened. Our results indicate that air pollution may change people's risk attitude in financial product consumption, and this effect becomes smaller if people get used to bad air quality.
